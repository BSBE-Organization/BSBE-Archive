b) Veema has 150 samples of RNA to use in CHIP seq. How much length of barcode is required?- 2 marks
2) a) Relationship between given organism from evolution tree.- 3 marks
b) 4 phylogenic tree given with rotated roots. Question was if all of them were same(like in slide 101 from slides).- 2 marks
3) a) Make phylogenetic profile of the given data.(There were 10 genes across 5 organisms)- 5 marks
b) We have 10 related protiens. 2 of them have one directional best hit and 4 of them do not have best hit. How many MOC do we have.- 2 marks(not sure about this one)
4) a) An unrooted tree is given with 1 missing 5 bp sequence. 5 probable sequence are given for the missing sequence. Use Maximum Parsimony method to find the most probable sequence.- 3 marks
b) Hemoglobin gene tree is made of rabbit, cow, dog and mice. It is compared with species tree and the trees do not match. What phenomenon is this called?- 2 marks
