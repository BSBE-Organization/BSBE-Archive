Section A(5x2 marks)
Q) how will you calculate information content from PSSM table
Q) All possible sequence of representations- [AG]-A-T-{AT} (something like this)
Q) Weather forecast possibility(cloudy, sunny, rainy) for next 10 days by using the table like in the slide HMM. Sequence given was like-"SRRRRCSCRRR"(something like this) Values from the table were missing(??) so we had to find them by adding them and equating to 1.
Q) HMM model was given and we had to find the missing values.
Q) Find Euclidian distance from the given 2 sequence with word count = 3.

Section B(5x4 marks)
Q) Calculate entropy of given sequences
Q) Find probability of sequence from HMM using forward algorithm(table was given with missing values). Sequence was 4 letter
Q) Perform global alignment and find best matches
Q) PSSM with table calculate maximum motif score
Q) Make phylogenic tree with given table

Section C(2x5 marks)
Q) HMM model(table with missing values again) was given and we had to find path taken and probability(had to use Viterbi algorithm)
Q) 4 sequence were given(6 letter each) with marked motif(3 letter), perform Gibbs Sampling Method to find best motif.
