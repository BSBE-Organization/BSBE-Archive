This course only have practical exam and end sem at the end of semester.
On day 1 only experiment 3, 5 and 7 were asked with aim, principle, method, observation, calculation and results were asked.
On day 2 experiment 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were asked with the same.
In the experiments which takes 2 days to perform like to find Kla, we were just given the data and we had to make the graphs.
Cheating was difficult on day 2 because the prof would sign at your sheets at 10 am and cut off all the blank spaces so you cannot write principle or method on them later.
